## üìä Database Design Considerations

For this MVP focused on Basketball:

1. **Indexes**
   - Game date and status (for quickly finding live and upcoming games)
   - Team ID (for team-specific queries)
   - Player ID (for player-specific queries)
   - League and Season combinations (for season-specific data)

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Denormalize frequently accessed data (e.g., team and player names in game records)
   - Create materialized views or pre-aggregated statistics for dashboards
   - Index shot location data for efficient heatmap generation

3. **Data Validation**
   - Ensure game scores match the sum of quarter scores
   - Validate player statistics against team totals
   - Ensure consistent game status transitions (scheduled ‚Üí live ‚Üí finished)

4. **Real-time Considerations**
   - Design for efficient partial updates of game data
   - Optimize for frequent reads and periodic writes during live games
