# üìä Sports Stats & Live Scores Dashboard - Data Structure Plan

## üéØ Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for mapping out the data structure of the Sports Stats & Live Scores Dashboard application. We'll focus on creating efficient, scalable, and well-organized data models that support real-time updates and visualization requirements specified in the PRD.

## üìã Step-by-Step Plan

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Requirements & Define Core Entities
- **Review existing documentation** (PRD, UX, SA) to identify all data needs
- **Identify core entities** needed in our domain model:
  - Sports (Basketball for MVP)
  - Teams
  - Players
  - Games/Matches
  - Leagues/Competitions
  - Seasons
  - Statistics (team and player level)
- **Map user stories to data requirements** to ensure our structure supports all use cases

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Design Entity Relationships
- **Define relationships between entities**:
  - Sport ‚Üí Leagues/Competitions
  - Leagues ‚Üí Teams
  - Teams ‚Üí Players
  - Teams ‚Üí Games (many-to-many)
  - Games ‚Üí Statistics
  - Players ‚Üí Statistics
- **Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** documenting these relationships
- **Determine cardinality** of each relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Develop Type Definitions
- **Create TypeScript interfaces** for each entity:
  ```typescript
  interface Sport { /* ... */ }
  interface League { /* ... */ }
  interface Team { /* ... */ }
  interface Player { /* ... */ }
  interface Game { /* ... */ }
  interface Statistic { /* ... */ }


  Define enums for status, positions, and other constants
Create specialized types for sport-specific data structures (basketball-specific stats)
Document all types with JSDoc comments
4Ô∏è‚É£ Design API Interface
Map required API endpoints to support all operations
Define request/response models for each endpoint
Create mock service implementations for development
Establish real-time update mechanisms (polling vs WebSockets)
Design error handling patterns for API interactions
5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement State Management
Define global app state structure:
User preferences
Current filters and selections
Cached data
Real-time data
Create context providers for sharing state
Design data fetching patterns (React Query, SWR, or custom hooks)
Implement optimistic updates for real-time feedback
6Ô∏è‚É£ Create Mock Data Generator
Define schema for mock data
Build generators for each entity type
Create realistic relationships between mock entities
Implement time-based progression for simulating live games
Ensure data consistency across related entities
7Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Data Transformation Layer
Create utilities for data normalization
Design adapter patterns for API responses
Build presentation-ready data structures for UI components
Implement caching strategies for performance optimization
8Ô∏è‚É£ Establish Data Validation
Define validation rules for each entity
Create validation utilities
Implement type guards for runtime type safety
Design error handling for invalid data
9Ô∏è‚É£ Design Data Persistence Strategy
Determine local storage requirements:
User preferences
Recent searches
Cached data
Implement storage adapters
Create migration strategies for schema changes
Define data expiration policies
üîü Test Data Structure
Create unit tests for data models
Test data transformations
Verify API interaction patterns
Validate real-time update mechanisms
Benchmark performance with realistic data volumes
üìä Specific Data Models (Basketball Focus)
Basketball Game Data
Game metadata: ID, date, venue, officials, attendance
Team information: Home/away teams, records, rankings
Score tracking: Points by quarter, current score, lead changes
Game status: Scheduled, live (with current time/quarter), final
Key statistics: Field goals, 3-pointers, free throws, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers
Player performance: Minutes played, points, +/- rating
Basketball Player Statistics
Basic info: Name, number, position, height, weight
Season averages: PPG, RPG, APG, SPG, BPG, FG%, 3P%, FT%
Advanced metrics: PER, true shooting %, usage rate, offensive/defensive rating
Game-specific stats: Points, rebounds, assists per game
Heatmap data: Shot locations, defensive coverage
Team Performance Data
Season records: Wins, losses, conference standing
Team statistics: Points per game, rebounds, assists, FG%
Performance trends: Last 10 games, home/away splits
Historical data: Previous season performances
Head-to-head records: Performance against specific opponents
